Axialotl is a 2D and 3D graphics library written in C.
It aims to be simple and relatively easy to learn, yet 
allow the user to do advanced and complicated things.

Axialotl is inspired by SFML, which is a C++ library for
2D graphics, however, they don't ressebly each other much
in code.

Dependencies (as of writing this):
  OpenGL - graphics library, what powers most of axia
  GLFW - library for creating windows for OpenGL as well as
         processing inputs
  GLEW - library for loading OpenGL's functions
  Freetype2 - font library, nessesary for text rendering
